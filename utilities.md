## <span id='3'>3. git</span> 

### 3.1 Terms
Here are some basic terms used in git operations:
* Directory -> Folder
* Terminal / Command Line
* CLI -> Command Line Interface
* cd -> Change Directory
* Repository -> the folder where the project is kept


### 3.2 git Concepts
Here are some basic concepts of git operations:
* clone -> to bring in a reposity elsewhere
* add -> track files and changes in git
* commit -> save files in git
* push -> upload git commits to remote repo
* pull -> download git from remote repo to local machine


### 3.3 Case Tutorial
Here is a practical case for git operations:  

**Case 1:**

* Create a new folder and create new files inside:   

  ```shell 
   $ mkdir git
   $ cd git 
   $ touch test.py index.html
  ```

* Initialize gitï¼š   
  `git init`

* Add stage changes:  
  `git add .` or &ensp; `git add test.py`

* Save by committing changes:  
  `git commit -m "message" -m "description"`

* Check git status anytime by:
  
  `git status` 

**Case 2:**  

* Now try to make some changes to the file:

  ```shell
  $ rm index.html
  $ touch app.js
  $ ls
  $ git add . 
  $ commit -m "delete and add"
  ```
* All the records could be tracked with all hash-codes by:  

   ```shell
   $ git log
   $ git checkout *hash-code* 
   ```

* Then get back to history versions by:  

  ```shell
  $ git reset -hard *hash-code*
  $ git merge master
  ```

* Now log on **Github**, create a new repository, copy its `SSH`.  

* Back to local, set remote git by:

   `git remote add origin *SSH*`

* Search for local branch, while most of the time it should be `main` or `master`:

  `git branch`

* Now local file could be pushed to **Github** by:

  `git push -u origin master`

  Beware that `-u` is a shortcut for later use of `git push`.

**Case 3:**

* Start a new branch by:

   `git branch -b feature`

* Only for test:
  ```shell
  $ git branch
  $ touch test2.java
  $ git log
  ```

* Now new branch could be pushed live like:  
  `git push origin feature`

* Back to Github,  a pull request could on found on **Github**, and you choose to merge or not to merge.

  Anyway, it could be synchronized like:
  `git pull origin master`

* Or  choose to merge at local like:

  `git merge master`

* Before that, any difference between the versions could be found as:

  `git diff master`

**Case 4:**

Start by cloning from **Github** like:  
  `git clone https://github.com/greatxue/greatxue.github.io.git`   


### 3.4 Key Commands
Here are key commads introduced above:

* `git init  `    # initialize project to use git

* `git add .`    # add all changes to be saved

* `git add *filename*`    # add single file to be saved

* `git commit -m "message"`    # savechanges with message

* `git push origin master`    # push changes to Github master

* `git push origin new-branch`    # push changes to Github new-branch

* `git pull origin master`    # pull changes from Github master

* `git checkout -b new-branch`     # create a new branch

* `git status`    # check status of changes

* `git log`    # see all previous saved changes

* `git checkout *commit hash*`    # travel back to old commit

## <span id='4'>4. vim</span> 

### 4.1 Quick start
**vim** could be accessed by entering &ensp;`vim *file*`&ensp; in the terminal. It could be divided into three modes, which are:
* Command mode
* Insert mode
* Last line mode


#### 4.1.1  **Command mode**
vim is at command mode when the user starts vi/vim.  
In this state, keystrokes are recognized by Vim as commands:
* `i` -> Switch to insert mode to input characters.
* `x` -> Delete the character under the cursor.
* `:` -> Switch to last line mode to enter a command on the last line.


#### 4.1.2 **Insert mode**
Pressing "i" in command mode enters insert mode. In insert mode, you can use the following keys:
* **(Shift) Character keys** -> input characters
* **ENTER** -> start a new line
* **BACK SPACE** -> delete the character before the cursor
* **DEL** -> delete the character after the cursor
* **Arrow keys** -> move the cursor within the text
e cursor changes to a vertical line/underscore
* **ESC** -> exit insert mode and switch to command mode


#### 4.1.3 **Last line mode**
Pressing ":" (colon) in command mode enters last line mode. 
* `:q` -> Quit the program
* `:w` -> Save the file


### 4.2 More commands
* **Multiple-file arrangement**

  ```shell
  vim *file1* *file2*
  :ls   # list all vim-opened files
  :b2   # show the second file
  :bn   # last file
  :bp   # next file
  vim -On *f1* *f2* filen  # left-right spilit screen
  vim -on *f1* *f2* filen  # top-down split screen
  ```

  Also availble with:

  `cmd` + `w` + **`s `** / **`v`**  -> top-down / left-right split

  `:sp newfile` / `:vsp newfile`-> t-d / l-r current with new file

  `cmd` + `w` + **`h`** / **`l`** /  **`k`** / **`j`** -> move cursor to left / right / up / down 

  `cmd` + `w` + **`H`** / **`L`** /  **`K`** / **`J`** -> move split to left / right / up / down 

  `cmd` + `w` + **`c `** /  **`q `** -> quit vim

* **Quit & save commands**

  ```shell
  :w   # save, not quit
  :w!   # force save, not quit
  :w *file*   # save change to file
  :q!   # quit, not save
  :qa!  # quit all, not save
  :wq  # quit & save
  :x   #quit & save
  :e *file*   # open another file
  :e!   # abandon change
  :saveas *file*   # save as
  
  
  
  ```
*
